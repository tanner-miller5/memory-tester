# Memory Tester App Overview

## Purpose
Memory Tester is a scientific application designed to assess and improve users' long-term memory retention capabilities through systematic testing and engagement over extended periods.

## Core Features

### Memory Test Creation
- Users can initiate new memory tests by uploading personal:
  - Pictures (static images)
  - Videos (short clips)

### Testing Schedule
The app implements a scientifically-based spaced repetition system with tests scheduled at:
- 24 hours (1 day)
- 1 week
- 2 weeks
- 1 month
- 2 months
- 3 months
- 6 months
- 1 year

### Test Mechanics
1. Initial Phase:
   - Users upload a sequence of personal pictures/videos to memorize when they were taken based on meta data.
   - Each item is shown for a predetermined duration with the date and time the picture were taken based on meta data.
   - Users can set their preferred content type (pictures or videos)

2. Testing Phase:
   - Users receive notifications at scheduled intervals
   - During each test, users must identify when previously uploaded content was taken
